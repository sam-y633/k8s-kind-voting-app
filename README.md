# K8s Kind Voting App

A comprehensive guide for setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Kind on an AWS EC2 instance, installing and configuring Argo CD, and deploying applications using Argo CD.

## Overview
This guide covers the steps to:

* Launch an AWS EC2 instance.
* Install Docker and Kind.
* Create a Kubernetes cluster using Kind.
* Install and access kubectl.
* Set up the Kubernetes Dashboard.
* Install and configure Argo CD.
* Connect and manage your Kubernetes cluster with Argo CD.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them in…
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time

## Notes

The voting application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.

This isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple
example of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to
deal with them in Docker at a basic level.
